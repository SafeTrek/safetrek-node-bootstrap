# SafeTrek Node Bootstrap

A bootstrap project to quickly get you started with the SafeTrek API using NodeJS.

### How to use

 - **Step 1:** [Request Access](https://developers.safetrek.io/) to SafeTrek API in order to get your `client_id` and `client_secret`
 - **Step 2:** [Create](https://www.heroku.com/) a free Heroku account, if you don't have one already.
 - **Step 3:** Use the *Deploy to Heroku* button below to create your new app off of this repository. Give your app a name and fill in your SafeTrek API credentials that you received from *Step 1*. Fill in the `REDIRECT_URL` only if you know what you're doing. If this is your first time using this repo, leave it blank.

- **Step 4:** Open up the app and go through the demo if you're new to working with SafeTrek API. The console outputs can give additional information during the demo, so keep an eye out for that.
- **Step 5:** Go through the code to better understand how everything works.
- **Step 6:** Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
- **Step 7:** Connect the forked repo to your Heroku app from the **Deploy** menu on Heroku's dashboard. (`https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/<your-app>/deploy/github`)
- **Step 8:** Now you can deploy any branch from your forked repo to your Heroku app. You can even setup auto-deploy if you want. All that's left to do is cloning your forked repo and pushing some changes!
