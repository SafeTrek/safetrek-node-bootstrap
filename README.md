# SafeTrek Node Bootstrap

A bootstrap project to quickly get you started with the SafeTrek API using NodeJS.

### How to use

 - **Step 1:** [Request Access](https://developers.safetrek.io/) to SafeTrek API in order to get your `client_id` and `client_secret`
 - **Step 2:** [Create](https://www.heroku.com/) a free Heroku account, if you don't have one already.
 - **Step 3:** Use the *Deploy to Heroku* button below to create your new app off of this repository. Give your app a name and fill in your SafeTrek API credentials that you received from *Step 1*. Fill in the `REDIRECT_URL` only if you know what you're doing. If this is your first time using this repo, leave it blank.
